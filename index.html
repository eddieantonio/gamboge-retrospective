              <p>Computing scientists have been using statistical techniques to analyze, digest, and understand natural language. We call these techniques natural language processing. Statistical method work because, despite the theoretical complexity of languages, most utterances in a language tend to exhibit some degree of regularity and repeatability.</p>
              <p>How many people use a predictive keyboard on their smartphone? So, this sometimes makes certain messages and utterances easier to type, because it predicts your next word based on your previous input to the system. This is an application of statistical natural language processing. In particular, the n-gram language model.</p>

              <p>We can find find common idioms in code---little snippets or templates of code, that are used a lot and infer what they mean, and what they mean about the code they're found in. And we can make it easier to input these snippets as well.</p>
              <p>And, there is code completion and code suggestion. You can predict the next word or punctuation in a programming language by simply asking the language model what it thinks. Abram and pals developed one such application, that predicts exactly one word or punctuation in the future.</p>

              Here is an animated /ʒaɪf/ of Gamboge predicting Python code.

              [ad lib about multi-token prediction, whitespace prediction].

              It's secret for producing multiple tokens is sorting suggestions
              using averaging the surprisal of each token in the suggestion:
              that is, the mean surprise.

            <h3 class="fragment"> (Steal this!) </h3>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>In an n-gram language model, we care about the surprisal of a
              sequence of tokens. I could bore you about negative log
              probability, but it's actually pretty intuitive: given some
              words and punctuation, how surprising is it to find it in the
              general language?

              <p>This give us an intuitive way at looking at the next token's
              probability. The most probable token following some sequence is
              the least surprising token after the sequence.  Indeed, we call
              this measure the surprise of the token sequence. An event that
              is certain to happen, would have a probability of 100%. It is
              “not surprising”, so its surprisal value is 0. Similarly, an
              impossible event (according to our model) would leave us
              “infinitely surprised”.

              <p>Adding another token to a suggestion will almost always
              increases the overall surprisal of the suggestion (unless that
              next token follows the last 100% of the time). So, how do we
              prioritize longer, but more useful suggestions? Instead of
              sorting suggestions based on the surprisal of the entire
              suggestion, we'll sort it according to the average, or mean
              surprise of the entire suggestion. This means for single token
              suggestions, its surprisal doesn't change. But for multitoken
              suggestions, where some tokens contribute very little to the
              surprisal of the suggestion, the longer suggestion is given.

              <p>$S_{i}$ is the rank of suggestion $i$. $I_{i}$ here is the
              surprisal of all of the tokens in this suggestion. Therefore,
              just divide the total of tokens in the suggestion and we get an
              arithmetic mean.

              (A thought occurs: do we want mean surprise or mean probability?
              Because, mean probability would require log transforming...).

              <p>It's effectiveness is left as an exercise for the reader...

              <p>And that's all I have about the theoretical component.

              <p> Developing for Atom, on one hand was really nice, because
                it's just javascript. It's built on top of Atom Electron.

              <p>Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell ) is basically the
              Chromium smushed together with Node.js.  It's pretty rad! And
              you can use it independently of Atom to make desktop apps in
              HTML and Javascript. No bundler (Browserify, WebPack) required.

              <p>Does anybosdy use Slack? Slack is made using Electron!

              <p>You can just use npm and `require` like normal, which grants you
              one of the best parts of javascript. Plus it has most front-end
              libraries, incluing React and jQuery. It's beautiful.

              <p>That said, it's React. So don't touch the DOM!

              language if it's going to highlight it. That said, using the
              tokens from the syntax highlighter is insufficient; its regular
              expressions often groups tokens together, or add whitespace to
              the defintion of a token that would otherwise lack it.
              Additionally, it knows nothing of the INDENT and DEDENT tokens
              in whitespace sensitive langauges (Python, Haskell, YAML,
              CoffeeScript), so it's completely useless for these langauges.

              <p>Luckily, one can use an external tool Esprima to do the

            <h3 class="fragment"> BAD IDEA </h3>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>I'd often get the rug pulled out underneath me as APIs were
              constantly changing. Not to mention the API docs were... lacking
              at best. I actually started a pull request to improve their docs
              for writing tests, and documenting the monkey-patching they did
              to make tests happen; but I ultimately did not complete it.

              <p>[Probably skip this] Also, the Vim-Mode was shit, and I actually learned plugin
              develpoing from having to patch the Vim-mode and <a
                href="https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/410">make a PR</a>.

              <p>At this point, I didn't know what React was, so I went ahead and
              modifed the DOM by hand. It's just JavaScript! But then they
              updated their React version which added aggressive checking of
              DOM invariants and inevitablly broke Gamboge. Gamboge has stayed
              in this state FOREVER.

              <p>In Atom, there's not good way to use any other testing framework
              than Jasmine 1.3. That's it. It's bundled in.

              <p>The testing facillities are pretty cool; you can fully script
              the editor.  Really neat! But a lot of my tests involved
              asynchronous code.  Who has tested asynchronous code in Jasmine
              prior to version 2?  It's a bad idea. It's clunky, and

          <h2> Conclusion </h2>

          <aside class="notes">

            <p>While there a few problem with Atom, if you're willing to put up
            with the mild absurdity of the community, its use of modern web-technologies
            makes it an incredible platform for making attractive text editor
            plugins.

            <p>The state of Atom <em>has</em> improved, and the fact that it's at 1.0
            means the API is moderatly stable; you shouldn't have the same
            problems as I did.

            <p>And if you don't like Atom itself, you can make your own text
            editor using Atom Electron.
