              Hey ya'll. I'm eddieantonio. Last year I wrote a plugin for
              GitHub's Atom editor For SCIENCE! (Pre 1.0).

              How many people don't know what Atom is?

              Okay, so Atom is like Sublime Text, but in JavaScript. It's
              meant to be a web-technology powered editor, and at the time of
              writing this plugin, it was... okay.

            <!-- Abram Collaborators... etc. -->
            <aside class="notes">
              Way back in the halcyon days of 2012, Abram Hindle and his
              collaborators sought to find the answer to one question. It's
              based on the premise that natural language processing tools ---
              tools for analyzing language produced by actual human beings --
              therefore, natural, have been used successfully on natural
              language --

            <aside class="notes">
            <!-- touch this text up... -->
              That is, the language that humans produce and use to
              communicated with each other.

              Why use n-gram models? Because it's easy! You don't need very
              knowledge of the programming language, and you don't need a lot
              of static analysis, especially that which would be difficult to
              pull off in real-time (for example, in JavaScript).

              An n-gram language model counts how many times a string of
              tokens has been seen in some training data, called its corpus.
              The n of n-gram denotes the order of the language model, or how
              many contiguous tokens are counted in the language model.

              Natural language tends to exhibits regularity and
              repetitiveness.

              But wait a minute... Language is
              a natural product of humans; and software is a product made by
              humans....

              Gamboge improves upon the methods made by Hindle et al. and Tu
              et al. by providing multi-token code suggestion. That is, it
              doesn't just predict one word or punctuation in advance; it
              predicts as many as it possibly can, exploiting the fact that
              code tends to be general.

            <aside class="notes">
              In an n-gram language model, we care about the surprisal of a
              sequence of tokens. It's literally just that: given some tokens,
              how surprising is it relative to the language model?

              This give us an intuitive way at looking at the next token's
              probability. The most probable token following some sequence is
              the least surprising token after the sequence.  Indeed, we call
              this measure the surprise of the token sequence. An event that
              is certain to happen, would have a probability of 100%. It is
              “not surprising”, so its surprisal value is 0. Similarly, an
              impossible event (according to our model) would leave us
              “infinitely surprised”.

              Adding another token to a suggestion will almost always
              increases the overall surprisal of the suggestion (unless that
              next token follows the last 100% of the time). So, how do we
              prioritize longer, but more useful suggestions? Instead of
              sorting suggestions based on the surprisal of the entire
              suggestion, we'll sort it according to the average, or mean
              surprise of the entire suggestion. This means for single token
              suggestions, its surprisal doesn't change. But for multitoken
              suggestions, where some tokens contribute very little to the
              surprisal of the suggestion, the longer suggestion is given.

              $S_{i}$ is the rank of suggestion $i$. $I_{i}$ here is the
              surprisal of all of the tokens in this suggestion. Therefore,
              just divide the total of tokens in the suggestion and we get an
              arithmetic mean.

              (A thought occurs: do we want mean surprise or mean probability?
              Because, mean probability would require log transforming...).

              It's effectiveness is left as an exercise for the reader...

              You can just use npm and `require` like normal, which grants you
              one of the best parts of javascript. Plus it has most front-end

              Earlier, I mentioned that all you need for an n-gram are those
              precious, precious tokens; basically, a syntax highlighter
              should probably have a good idea of what tokens are in a
              language if it's going to highlight it. That said, using the
              tokens from the syntax highlighter is insufficient; its regular
              expressions often groups tokens together, or add whitespace to
              the defintion of a token that would otherwise lack it.
              Additionally, it knows nothing of the INDENT and DEDENT tokens
              in whitespace sensitive langauges (Python, Haskell, YAML,
              CoffeeScript), so it's completely useless for these langauges.

              Luckily, one can use an external tool Esprima to do the
              tokenization for you.

            <aside class="notes">
              I'd often get the rug pulled out underneath me as APIs were
              constantly changing. Not to mention the API docs were... lacking
              at best. I actually started a pull request to improve their docs
              for writing tests, and documenting the monkey-patching they did
              to make tests happen; but I ultimately did not complete it.

              At this point, I didn't know what React was, so I went ahead and
              modifed the DOM by hand. It's just JavaScript! But then they
              updated their React version which added aggressive checking of
              DOM invariants and inevitablly broke Gamboge. Gamboge has stayed
              in this state FOREVER.

              Speaking of tests...

              Also, the Vim-Mode was shit, and I actually learned plugin

              In Atom, there's not good way to use any other testing framework
              than Jasmine 1.3. That's it. It's bundled in.

              The testing facillities are pretty cool; you can fully script
              the editor.  Really neat! But a lot of my tests involved
              asynchronous code.  Who has tested asynchronous code in Jasmine
              prior to version 2?  It's a bad idea. It's clunky, and
              problematic. This was the source of much frustration.

          <h2> Conclusion </h2>

          <aside class="notes">

            While there a few problem with Atom, if you're willing to put up
            with the mild absurdity of the community, its use of modern web-technologies
            makes it an incredible platform for making attractive text editor
            plugins.

            The state of Atom *has* improved, and the fact that it's at 1.0
            means the API is moderatly stable; you shouldn't have the same
            problems as I did.

            And if you don't like Atom itself, you can make your own text
            editor using Atom Electron.
